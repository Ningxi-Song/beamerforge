# Beamer Design System

A catalog of Beamer design elements with AI-assisted template generation. Browse elements, pick what you like, and AI assembles them into a complete, compilable template.

## How It Works

Design flows from **vague to specific**. See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for the full process.

```
Vibe → Direction → Palette → Details → Template

"I want something modern"  →  3 directions  →  3 palettes  →  fine-tune  →  .tex file
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Tell Us the Vibe

Describe the overall feeling in natural language. No technical terms needed.

```
"I want something modern and techy"
"Make it look like a serious academic talk"
"Something clean and minimal"
```

### Step 2: Pick a Direction

We show 2-3 visual directions based on your vibe. Each is a mood board — a single slide showing color palette, font feel, and overall tone.

### Step 3: Pick a Palette

We suggest 2-3 specific color + font combinations within your chosen direction.

### Step 4: Fine-tune Details

We ask about bullets, blocks, navigation, and title page — one at a time, with visual previews.

### Step 5: Get Your Template

We generate a complete `.tex` file with:
- All selected elements combined
- Compilation instructions
- Customization guide

## For AI Users

This repository is designed to be read by AI as context. When you ask AI to create a Beamer template, point it to this repo:

```
Read the Beamer design catalog at [repo-url], then create a template
using: colors/dark-blue, typography/sans-serif-modern, layout/16-9-single
```

AI will:
1. Read the relevant element files
2. Understand the design constraints
3. Generate a complete, compilable template
4. Review it against the guidelines

## Element Naming Convention

Each element uses a consistent ID format:

```
{category}/{name}
```

Examples:
- `colors/dark-blue` — dark blue color theme
- `colors/light-green-minimal` — light green minimal theme
- `typography/serif-classic` — classic serif font combination
- `frames/title-center` — centered title page layout
